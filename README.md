### What and Why:

Currently, we have many centralized blogging apps Medium but constantly. The way writing is distributed, interpreted, applied, and valued is wrong. With Donald Trump suspended from Twitter and Facebook, and Parler kicked off AWS, there is renewed discussion about what sort of speech is acceptable online, and how it should be enforced. These bans were justified however, they do raise questions that need to be discussed, especially within the technology community.

With all of these, some cases will be very clear on one side or the other of the dividing line, but there will always be a large grey area of cases that are unclear and a matter of subjective interpretation.

Through a decentralized, user-owned, crypto-based network, the platform revolutionizes the way we express, share, and monetize our thoughts. Users can connect with their wallets and upload a blog. If that blog is genuine people can upvote the correct content. As a result, our platform is a sum of our contributors.

The project is deployed on Matic Mumbai so that users publish blogs with a low gas fee. Users can upvote, downvote, and reply to a post. Used **The Graph** to update the feed instantly as fetching the data directly.

### Challenges I ran into

Syncing and updating feed without using database was the hard part. Solved the issue using The Graph, fetched the latest post, upvotes, downvotes, and update feed instantly.

#### Run Locally

add all .env files

```bash

```
