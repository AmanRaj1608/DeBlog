#### About Project:

Created a completely decentralized blogging app using **The Graph** protocol.
Using Graph I am fetching live data feed of all activity to instantly update the feed.
No need for a centralized database needed to track upvotes and replies.

Users can connect with their wallets and upload a blog. If that blog is genuine people can upvote and reply. All transaction on MATIC network.

#### Tech Stack

Frontend - TypeScipt, Nextjs, graphql, Apollo
subgraph - Graph Cli
Smart Contract - USed hardat + TypeScipt by [solidity-template](https://github.com/paulrberg/solidity-template)
